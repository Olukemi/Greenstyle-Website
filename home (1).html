                    <h1>About Us</h1>
                    <p>The Greenstyle app will have various concepts to properly educate and create awareness. The main idea is to have
                      weekly challenges that follow a specific lifestyle in the following categories: Electricity Waste, Resources, Water Reduction,
                      Transportation, and Recycling. <br><br> The user is given various tasks each day depending on the category they choose for the week,
                      and is challenged to complete them to the best of their capabilities.  Before the weekly challenge, the users are asked for
                      their best estimate of how much they would contribute to the chosen climate change topic, and at the end of the week are given
                      a comparison of this estimate, a report on how they did compared to other users, and advice. By doing so, it demonstrates to the
                      user how much a difference a sustainable lifestyle can make. <br><br> This app will also allow users to compete with friends and family
                      to see who can complete the most challenges, or stick to a sustainable lifestyle. This challenge consists of the user trying to
                      preserve water through out the week. A daily challenge could be showering for 5 mins or doing the dishes at the end of the at once.

                       or challenged to only charge their phone once in a day, which can teach them to preserve battery life.

                      to preserve food. The app could suggest a tip like “when eating out ask the waiter for a portion of the food
                      they serve.”

                    <p>Paper, toilet paper, plastic bags/ziplock. Reusing and recycling these resources can reduce carbon
                      footprint, save money and well we can save some trees! Write notes on a document instead of on paper and if you don’t have
                      access to an electronic device, use a whiteboard and take pictures to refer to later.
